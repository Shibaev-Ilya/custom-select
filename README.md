# custom-select
My version of a custom select input, with filtering

## To Do
* Move status update to start on first focus, not on page load
* Add the high-contrast focus indicator back (not sure when that got removed?)
* Add aria-selected attributes to makeChoice, remove on clearValue
* check arrow navigation works in all screen readers - seems to be worst in Talkback.
